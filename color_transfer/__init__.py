def color_transfer(source, target, clip=True, preserve_paper=True):
	"""
	Transfers the color distribution from the source to the target
	image using the mean and standard deviations of the L*a*b*
	color space.

	This implementation is (loosely) based on to the "Color Transfer
	between Images" paper by Reinhard et al., 2001.

	Parameters:
	-------
	source: NumPy array
		OpenCV image in BGR color space (the source image)
	target: NumPy array
		OpenCV image in BGR color space (the target image)
	clip: Should components of L*a*b* image be scaled by np.clip before 
		converting back to BGR color space?
		If False then components will be min-max scaled appropriately.
		Clipping will keep target image brightness truer to the input.
		Scaling will adjust image brightness to avoid washed out portions
		in the resulting color transfer that can be caused by clipping.
	preserve_paper: Should color transfer strictly follow methodology
		layed out in original paper? The method does not always produce
		aesthetically pleasing results.
		If False then L*a*b* components will scaled using the reciprocal of
		the scaling factor proposed in the paper.  This method seems to produce
		more consistently aesthetically pleasing results 

	Returns:
	-------
	transfer: NumPy array
		OpenCV image (w, h, 3) NumPy array (uint8)
